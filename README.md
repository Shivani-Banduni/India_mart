Yes, I know what you might be thinking. How is it possible to make the clone with just 4 technologies. We’ll as we have just started our humble journey to learn full-stack web development at the Masai school, we just knew these technologies so far. But I hope you would really appreciate the amount of precision and the perfectness we have achieved. To know how we did it please keep reading.

Now answering the big question of how we did it, I would like to say that it is because of the guidance of our coading instructure Chandrsekhar & the dedication towards making the website pixel perfect, I and my wonderful teammates had, we able to achieve our goal. As part of Masai school, we have always believed on skills and understand complicated things and make them simple to understand, we were able to create the page with following resources.
The following resources are:-
https://fontawesome.com/
. Material Icons https://github.com/google/material-design-icons
https://www.w3schools.com/
#Roles and Responsibilities:-
Day -1:-
Firstly we just go to GitHub and clone down the project to our personal computers
we started by going through the websites, studying its design, layouts , and collect all information in the website.
There are many pages on the website, but due to a shortage of time, we decided to go for only 5 pages main and under this pages 20 page are subpages, the home page and its subpages like features, pricing, login, sign-up followed the home page itself.
We started to go with the home page first.We split the main page into three parts the top section, the midsection, and the last section.
Day 2 :-
This day, we planned to assign each one of us with separate pages, and complete lending page, after that start building all sub pages , and few members collecting data and few members are mapping that. Its all about day 2.
Day 3:-
In the day 3 we planned to go for more feature sub-pages s but were able to make it out with one page only as it was quite a lengthy process, that’s why we make some more sub pages.
After that we all optimized all the pages we had completed till now, looking for small mistakes regarding style, font, hover etc . and after completing all project we working on blog.
#Issues we faced:-
when we are working on the home page, we were not sure about the landing page,
We faced some issues in Github when we were trying to push and merge the files we created.
Even after getting a couple of suggestions from our mentors, we were still facing issues while pushing, merging files, looking after the conflicts, and creating branches.
When we were saving the data in Local storage it was not showing UI .
# Solution :-
It takes lot of time but finally after exploring each and every option in Github we learn how to use this. And rest of the issues were solved after discussing it with all the teamates.
